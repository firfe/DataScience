1.You're testing advertising emails for a bathing suit company and you test one version of the email in February and the other in May.
I am assuming that people that recieve the advertising email in May will be more likely to click into the email or buy the bathing suits compared to people that recieve it in February. This is because May is the beginning of the summer months and summer time is usually the time frame in which people go to the beach and wear thinner clothing due to the hotter weather and sunnier days. The initial design of this advertisement is to detect whether or not seasonal wear such as bathing suits can sell during the off seasons with advertising emails.

2.You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a higher rate of anxiety than the general population.
If the clinic is known to treat for anxiety then it is highly likely that a person that wishes to be cured for anxiety will go there compared to any other clinic. This causes the data to become skewed for the clinic and thus biased. It would probably be more helpful to compare said clinic with another clinic that treats anxiety, and in this way tell if the rate in which people with anxiety come to the clinic is much higher.

3.You launch a new ad billboard based campaign and see an increase in website visits in the first week.
The increase in website visits is most likely due to the billboard based campaign because the website is now exposed to a larger audience then it was before. However it is also possible that the week you chose to test the new ad is also a time in which your website normally does attract more traffic (for example, a holiday gift shop during the week before christmas). 

4.You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week.
This is most likely due to the fact that a loyalty program targets consumers that have been with the website for a longer period of time and thus its benefits does not affect newer users. However there should be a long term change once more and more people become exposed to the loyalty program and its benefits become more known among the population.
