1.Does a new supplement help people sleep better?
Two versions: One group eats a pill with the new supplement and the other eats a dummy pill that has no effect.

Sample: Ideally a group of people that have similar sleeping problems, or a group of people in the same age that have
been monitored to display similar sleeping habits (sleep around a certain time, sleep for a certain amount of time)

Hypothesis: I expect the number of people that that have taken the new supplement to fall asleep earlier if the pill is taken earlier then their regular sleep time. 

Outcome(s): A change in sleeping time once the supplement is taken (e.g a earlier or later sleeping time from the normal), or the length of which they sleep is shorter or longer. These values can easily be recorded by the patient or doctor and then compared to determine the change.

Other measured variables: Health history, body mass of the testers, ethnicity and time at which the supplement is taken. Possible that people that take the supplement become more active instead or the supplment not having any effect whatsoever on the tester.

2.Will new uniforms help a gym's business?
Two versions: During the first month don't use the uniforms, then over the next month have the gym require a dresscode with the new uniforms.

Sample:Have only the staff at the gym wear the uniform and keep the times at which they work consistent through the months.

Hypothesis: Uniforms promote a more professional vibe and will thus attract more people to come to the gym because they feel it is better managed.  

Outcome(s): More memberships are given out over the month that the uniform is being used. More trainers are being hired, as well as a larger turn out during planned events/activities. All of this information can be recorded by the staff in charge of the event, or the receptionist who deals with giving out memberships/keeping track of members within the gym. 

Other measured variables:The amount of staff on hand and in each department should be the same (e.g trainers/receptionist/janitors). Membership amount should be monitored as well as how many members show up per day. It is possible that having uniforms also scares potential customers away depending on the demographic of the gym.

3.Will a new homepage improve my online exotic pet rental business?
Two versions:The old website and the new improved website.

Sample: The best sample will be the subscribers to the site as they are the group that are the most consistent as well as most familiar with the old website.

Hypothesis: There will be more people that enjoy the new refreshing look of the website then there are people that say they dislike it. 

Outcome(s): Overall more traffic and more click-thrus on the site. Possibly more purchases as well due to a renewed interest in the site. These can all be monitored from the host computer. 

Other measured variables: The overall design of the new homepage can effect how efficient it is in "improving" the website. Factors such as colors,UI layout and load times can all effect how much of an improvment the website is over the old website. The test overall is too broad and a smaller test such as a color/font change would have been a better initial test then a entire new homepage redesign (if that is what they did).

4.If I put 'please read' in the email subject will more people read my emails?
Two versions: One email states only the subject while the other email has the 'please read' in the subject header.

Sample: The best sample in this case would be a random sample of 1000 people for both email types. If people are expecting the email, it is possible that their actions will change. Alot of other factors such as culture/ethnicity/age/education can heavily affect whether you open a suspicious email that says 'please read'. So a non-controlled but large sample is the most accurate way to gauge how effectve it is.

Hypothesis: I suspect that people that recieve the 'please read' emails will be more likely to open it.

Outcome(s): I expect that because the email is politely asking for your attention, that it is more probably for the reciever to give it their attention. However the opposite is also possible, because the email is asking for their attention it is also possible that it will dissuade them from opening it, because it is suspicious. The key metric is if they open the email or not which can be recorded.

Other measured variables: Different fonts, or different subjects can also incite the reciever to open the email. For example, it is probably much more enticing to open a email that says "please read, you are the nicest person and this is why" then "please read, because you are an idiot". In order to keep it "fair", it is important for the subject to be tone neutral in its wording and neutral in its subject matter. (So not biased in for example "please read, if you are a republican")
